Hi, I'm Touhid Bin Amin. I'm a Frontend Web Developer with a passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I mainly work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Right now, I'm learning backend development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to become a full-stack developer. I'm also learning about Firebase Authentication and JWT for secure login systems.

I enjoy learning new things, solving problems, and building useful web applications. My goal is to improve every day and build projects that help people in real life..
